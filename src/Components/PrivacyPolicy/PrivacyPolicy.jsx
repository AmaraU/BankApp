                    <b>True Depth API Usage</b>
                    <br />

                    ARM MFB uses the <b>True Depth API</b> within the camera module to enhance the liveness check during the Know Your Customer (KYC) process, 
                    as required by account opening regulations. 
                    This technology ensures that the video submitted is being recorded live and belongs to the user.
                </p>


                <h4>What We Collect</h4>
                <p>
                    The app gathers the following data during the liveness check:

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Camera Intrinsic Matrix:</b> Information about the camera's internal properties.</li>
                        <li><b>Facial Expressions and Head Orientation:</b> To verify live interaction.</li>
                        <li><b>Camera Position:</b> To validate that the video is captured in real-time and is not pre-recorded.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h4>How We Use This Data</h4>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The video is shared with a third-party service provider solely to confirm the user's identity.</li>
                        <li>The data is deleted after the verification process, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>


                <h4>Third-Party Obligations</h4>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Our third-party service provider is bound by data protection laws and prohibited from using the data for marketing or any other purpose outside the agreed scope.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>


                <h4>User Rights</h4>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users can opt out of the video capture process at any time. However, opting out may limit the ability to complete KYC verification, restricting access to certain services.</li>
                    </ul>

                    Cookies can be used by web servers to identify and track users as they navigate different pages on a website, and to identify users returning to a website.
                    Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies.
                    A persistent cookie consists of a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, 
                    which will be stored by the browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date (unless deleted by the user before the expiry date).
                    A session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
